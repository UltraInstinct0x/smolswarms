# SmolSwarms 🌊

Building swarms of AI agents that hit different fr fr! More autonomous than my coffee machine, more coordinated than my sleep schedule.

## What's This? 🤔

SmolSwarms is a quantum evolution of multi-agent systems, heavily inspired by and building upon some incredible open source projects:

### Standing on the Shoulders of Giants 🙏

- **[LibreChat](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat)** - Our chat interface and core infrastructure is based on this amazing project. We're incredibly grateful to @danny-avila and all LibreChat contributors for creating such a solid foundation under MIT license. We've modified and extended it to create a specialized swarm-focused experience.

- **[SmolAgent](https://github.com/smol-ai/agent)** - The OG inspiration for our approach to minimal, effective AI agents. Major props to @swyxio for showing us how to keep it smol and effective.

### What We Added 🚀

We took LibreChat's solid foundation and added:
- Swarm coordination protocols that hit different
- Agent spawning mechanics smoother than my git history
- Memory systems more persistent than my attention span
- Token management more optimized than my Chrome tabs

## Quick Start 🏃‍♂️

```bash


# Clone with all the quantum sauce
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ultrainstinct0x/smolswarms.git

# Enter the quantum realm
cd smolswarms/apps/chat

# Copy example configs (and edit them if needed)
cp librechat/.env.example .env
cp librechat/docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml

# Let it cook
docker compose -f librechat/docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up
```

## Features That Slap 💯

- **Agent Spawning**: Create AI agents faster than I create new Discord servers
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Because two heads are better than one (and 10 heads are quantum)
- **Memory Management**: More reliable than my actual memory
- **Token Economy**: Keep those API costs lower than my motivation on Monday mornings

## Development 🛠️

Check out our [Development Guide](docs/development.md) for:
- Local setup more organized than my browser tabs
- Testing that actually works
- Contribution guidelines that make sense

## License 📜

MIT - Because we believe in open source fr fr. Just like LibreChat and SmolAgent showed us the way, we're keeping it open for the next wave of innovation.

## Acknowledgments 🙏

This project wouldn't be possible without:
- The incredible [LibreChat](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat) project and its amazing community
- [SmolAgent](https://github.com/smol-ai/agent) for the inspiration
- The entire open source community fr fr

*Remember: With great power comes great responsibility... and with SmolSwarms, you've got more power than a Discord mod during a raid.* 💪
