When making changes to the codebase, follow these rules that are more strict than a Discord server's automod:

1. ALWAYS run these commands before committing (no exceptions, this ain't a TAS where we can skip cutscenes):
   ```bash
   ruff check . && black . --check && mypy smolswarms/
   ```

2. If any of those checks fail, you gotta fix the code until it passes all of them fr fr. Code quality here is more important than frame-perfect inputs in a speedrun.

3. When explaining your changes, break it down like you're doing a glitch explanation video:
   - What changes did you make (with receipts)
   - Why you made them (big brain energy)
   - How you tested them (show them debug logs)

4. For PR creation, make it more descriptive than a Dark Souls boss introduction cutscene.

Remember: We're trying to keep this code base cleaner than my browser history after clearing cache! ðŸ§¹âœ¨
