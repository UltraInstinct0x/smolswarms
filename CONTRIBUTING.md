# Contributing to smolswarms

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! You're about to make agent swarms even more based.

## 🤔 How Can I Contribute?

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs

- Check if the bug has already been reported in the Issues
- If not, create a new issue with:
  - Clear title that goes hard
  - Steps to reproduce (we need that replay value)
  - Expected behavior vs what actually happened
  - Any relevant logs/screenshots

### 🚀 Suggesting Enhancements

Got ideas that would make smolswarms go even harder? Create an issue with:
- Clear description of the feature
- Why it's based
- Any implementation ideas you have

### 💻 Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Write code that doesn't make the linter cry
4. Add tests because we ain't about that "it works on my machine" life
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Added some AmazingFeature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## 📝 Style Guide

- We use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting
- Type hints are not optional (this ain't JavaScript)
- Comments should be both helpful and entertaining
- If you're not using f-strings, why even code?

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=smolswarms
```

## 📚 Documentation

- Use docstrings that actually explain things
- Update the docs if you change anything
- Add examples that slap

Remember: Good code is like a good meme - self-explanatory but with layers of complexity that reward deeper investigation.
