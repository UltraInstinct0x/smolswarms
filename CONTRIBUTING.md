# Contributing to SmolSwarms 🌊

First off, thanks for considering contributing to SmolSwarms! Your help makes this project more based than a recursively optimized neural net fr fr.

## 💫 The Vibe Check

Before diving in deeper than a speedrunner looking for glitches, here's what you need to know:

- **Python 3.10+**: We only fw with modern Python features
- **Type Hints**: More required than a Discord server verification
- **Tests**: Write them like you're documenting a speedrun strat
- **Documentation**: Should be clearer than RTX ray tracing

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork & Clone**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smolswarms.git
   cd smolswarms
   ```

2. **Set Up Dev Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create a venv (isolation more important than a Minecraft bedrock wall)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

   # Install dependencies (with that developer DLC)
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/something_fire
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Flow

1. **Write Code**:
   - Type hints are mandatory (more strict than a Python linter fr fr)
   - Follow our coding style (black formatter = no cap)
   - Document your functions (docstrings hit different)

2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Run the whole test suite
   pytest

   # Check coverage (gotta hit that 100% fr fr)
   pytest --cov=smolswarms
   ```

3. **Format & Lint**:
   ```bash
   # Format your code (make it cleaner than a fresh install)
   black .

   # Run the linter (find bugs before they find you)
   ruff check .

   # Type check (because dynamic typing is too yolo)
   mypy smolswarms/
   ```

## 🎮 Using OpenHands Agent

Need help with your PR? Just tag `@openhands-agent` in a comment:

```markdown
yo @openhands-agent this code be acting sus, can you help optimize it?
```

OpenHands will:
1. Review your changes faster than a TAS script
2. Suggest improvements that hit different
3. Maybe even fix bugs for you fr fr

## 📝 Commit Guidelines

- Use emoji prefixes that actually mean something:
  - 🚀 `:rocket:` for features
  - 🐛 `:bug:` for fixes
  - 📚 `:books:` for docs
  - 🧪 `:test_tube:` for tests
  - 🔧 `:wrench:` for configs

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "🚀 feat: added agent swarm optimization that's more fire than a GPU running Crysis"
```

## 🤝 Pull Request Process

1. **Update Tests**: Add tests that are more thorough than a speedrunner's route notes
2. **Update Docs**: Document everything like you're writing a Wikipedia page from the future
3. **Check CI**: Make sure all checks pass (green is the new black fr fr)
4. **Request Review**: Tag maintainers who actually understand your galaxy brain code
5. **Address Feedback**: Faster than a Discord mod responding to pings
