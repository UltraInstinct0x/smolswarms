## Usage Guide

This prompt makes your AI assistant go absolutely bonkers with tool utilization, treating every task like it's a TAS speedrun with frame-perfect execution.

### Key Features
- Meta tool usage that's more galaxy brain than a 5D chess tournament
- Knowledge management that tracks everything like a Dark Souls player tracks boss patterns
- Filesystem operations with the precision of a Minecraft redstone engineer
- Version control that treats every commit like a save point before a boss fight
- Database operations tracking stats like an MMO player's DPS spreadsheet

### Pro Tips
- Always start with sequential thinking (it's like setting up your combo chain)
- Keep your knowledge graph updated (your quest log needs to stay current)
- Use git checkpoints religiously (because you ain't trying to lose progress)
- Automate everything that moves (if it happens twice, it needs a macro)
