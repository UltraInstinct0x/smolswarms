# SmolSwarms 🤖

Welcome to SmolSwarms, where we're building swarms of AI agents that hit different fr fr! This ain't your grandma's multi-agent system - we're talking next-level coordination with that zoomer energy 🚀

## What's the Vibe? ✨

SmolSwarms is a Python library that lets you create and coordinate swarms of AI agents with less effort than explaining a meme to your parents. We're all about:

- 🎮 **Agent Coordination**: Organize your AI agents better than your Discord server
- 🧠 **Swarm Intelligence**: Because two heads are better than one (and 100 heads are even better)
- 🔄 **Dynamic Scaling**: Scale your swarms up and down smoother than your Spotify crossfade
- 🤝 **OpenHands Integration**: AI helping AI, we really in the future fr fr
- 🛡️ **Token Management**: Keep those API costs lower than your motivation on Monday mornings

## Quick Start 🚀

```python
from smolswarms import SwarmFactory, Agent

# Create a swarm factory (spawning agents like they're Minecraft villagers)
factory = SwarmFactory()

# Define your agent's personality (more unique than your Discord PFP)
agent_config = {
    "personality": "zoomer",
    "energy_level": "caffeinated",
    "communication_style": "memes"
}

# Spawn your first agent (it's alive!)
agent = factory.create_agent(config=agent_config)

# Let it cook
agent.do_something_cool()
```

## Features That Slap 💯

- **Recursive Agent Spawning**: It's agents all the way down
- **Cross-Swarm Communication**: Your agents will be sliding into each other's DMs
- **Memory Persistence**: More reliable than your commitment to inbox zero
- **Token Economy**: Managing resources better than your crypto portfolio
- **Self-Optimization**: These agents level up faster than your gaming skills

## Installation 📦

```bash
pip install smolswarms  # real ones use pip
```
