## Getting Started

You ever look at an AI agent and think "what if there were more of them?" Well, you've come to the right place fr fr. SmolSwarms is basically Kubernetes but for AI agents (and 100% more cursed).

```python
from smolswarms import SwarmFactory

# Spawn your corporate hivemind in 3 lines no cap
factory = SwarmFactory()
swarm = factory.spawn_department({
    "business_unit": "growth_team",
    "budget": "infinite_money_glitch",
    "vibe": "hypergrowth"
})

# Watch the magic happen
swarm.execute_autonomously()
```

## Why SmolSwarms Though?

- üè≠ **Agent Factory System**: Spawning specialized AI agents faster than you can say "recursive automation"
- üß† **Big Brain Energy**: Uses Claude-3 as the director agent to design optimal architectures
- üí∞ **Token Economic Policy**: Built-in optimization to keep your OpenAI bill from going to the moon
- ü§ù **Agent Communication Protocol**: They're like Discord servers but for AI agents
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety First**: Sandboxed execution environments because we ain't trying to speedrun Skynet
