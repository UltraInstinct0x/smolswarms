# Examples ðŸŽ®

Let's see SmolSwarms in action with some examples that actually slap fr fr!

## Basic Usage ðŸŒ±

### Single Agent Example

The simplest way to get started (like your first Discord bot):

```python
from smolswarms import SwarmFactory

# Initialize the factory
factory = SwarmFactory(api_key="your-key")

# Create a basic agent
agent = factory.create_agent(
    role="researcher",
    personality="zoomer"
)

# Give it a task
result = agent.execute_task(
    "Find the latest AI papers on swarm intelligence",
    max_tokens=500
)

print(result.summary)
```

### Basic Swarm Example

When one agent isn't enough (like your Discord mod team):

```python
from smolswarms import SwarmFactory
from smolswarms.core import SwarmConfig

# Configure your swarm
config = SwarmConfig(
    swarm_size=3,
    agent_type="researcher",
    communication_style="professional"
)

# Create the swarm
factory = SwarmFactory(api_key="your-key")
swarm = factory.create_swarm(config)

# Execute a group task
results = swarm.execute_group_task(
    "Research and summarize recent developments in AI safety",
    max_tokens=1000
)

print(results.consensus_summary)
```

## Advanced Examples ðŸ”¥

### Specialized Research Swarm

Create a research team more organized than your Chrome tabs:

```python
from smolswarms import SwarmFactory
from smolswarms.agents import SpecializedAgent
from smolswarms.core import SwarmNetwork

# Create specialized agents
researcher = SpecializedAgent(
    role="lead_researcher",
    skills=["paper_analysis", "trend_spotting"]
)

analyst = SpecializedAgent(
    role="data_analyst",
    skills=["data_processing", "visualization"]
)

writer = SpecializedAgent(
    role="technical_writer",
    skills=["documentation", "communication"]
)

# Set up the network
network = SwarmNetwork()
network.add_agent(researcher, role="coordinator")
network.add_agent(analyst, role="processor")
network.add_agent(writer, role="communicator")

# Enable communication
network.enable_communication()

# Execute research pipeline
results = network.execute_pipeline([
    "gather_papers",
    "analyze_data",
    "write_report"
])
```

### Token-Optimized Swarm

Keep those API costs lower than your motivation on Monday mornings:

```python
from smolswarms import SwarmFactory
from smolswarms.utils import TokenManager, optimize_tokens

# Set up token management
manager = TokenManager(
    budget_limit=1000,
    optimization_level="aggressive"
)

# Create an optimized swarm
factory = SwarmFactory()
swarm = factory.create_swarm(
    size=5,
    token_manager=manager
)

# Monitor and optimize token usage
while swarm.is_active():
    usage = manager.get_usage()
    if usage.is_high():
        optimize_tokens(swarm, level="aggressive")

    results = swarm.execute_task(
        "Continue research with optimized tokens",
        max_tokens=100
    )
```

### Self-Improving Swarm

These agents level up faster than your gaming skills:

```python
from smolswarms import SwarmFactory
from smolswarms.core import LearningConfig

# Configure learning parameters
learning_config = LearningConfig(
    learning_rate=0.1,
    improvement_threshold=0.8,
    max_iterations=100
)

# Create a learning swarm
factory = SwarmFactory()
swarm = factory.create_learning_swarm(
    size=3,
    learning_config=learning_config
)

# Train the swarm
for epoch in range(10):
    # Execute task and learn from results
    results = swarm.execute_task_and_learn(
        "Solve complex problem with current knowledge",
        feedback_loop=True
    )

    # Check improvement
    if results.performance > 0.9:
        print("Swarm has achieved big brain energy!")
        break
```

## Error Handling Examples ðŸ”§

Because things will break (they always do):

```python
from smolswarms import SwarmFactory
from smolswarms.exceptions import SwarmError, TokenError

# Create a factory with error handling
factory = SwarmFactory()

try:
    # Try to create a massive swarm
    swarm = factory.create_swarm(size=1000)
except SwarmError as e:
    print(f"Too many agents fr fr: {e}")
    # Fall back to a smaller swarm
    swarm = factory.create_swarm(size=10)

try:
    # Try to execute an expensive task
    results = swarm.execute_task(
        "Analyze the entire internet",
        max_tokens=1000000
    )
except TokenError as e:
    print(f"We ain't made of money: {e}")
    # Fall back to a cheaper task
    results = swarm.execute_task(
        "Analyze just Reddit instead",
        max_tokens=1000
    )
```

## Best Practices ðŸ’¡

1. Start with single agents before creating swarms
2. Use specialized agents for specific tasks
3. Always implement error handling
4. Monitor and optimize token usage
5. Enable logging for debugging
