# üó∫Ô∏è SmolSwarms Development Roadmap

Welcome to the most ambitious crossover event since my last git merge conflict fr fr üöÄ

## Current Implementation Status üìä

### Core Systems (The Backend Squad)
- [x] Base SwarmFactory (spawning agents like it's a gacha game)
- [x] Basic agent coordination (more synchronized than gamers during a raid)
- [x] Memory persistence system (because amnesia ain't the vibe)
- [x] OpenHands integration (AI helping AI, we really in the future)
- [ ] Token economy system (keeping them API costs lower than my self-esteem)

### Agent Capabilities (The Skill Tree)
- [x] Basic task execution (they do be working tho)
- [ ] Inter-agent communication (like Discord but make it AI)
- [ ] Learning from failures (more resilient than my code after code review)
- [ ] Adaptive behavior patterns (evolving faster than my excuses)

### Infrastructure (The Support Team)
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD (more reliable than my alarm clock)
- [x] Automated testing (trust but verify fr fr)
- [x] Documentation system (more thorough than my Google search history)
- [ ] Performance monitoring (watching them metrics like a helicopter parent)

## Under Construction üöß

### Q1 2024 Objectives
1. Agent Communication Protocol v1
   - Direct messaging system (sliding into agent DMs)
   - Broadcast capabilities (for when you need to @ everyone)
   - Error handling (because even AI gets confused sometimes)

2. Enhanced Memory Systems
   - Persistent storage (more reliable than my promises to go to gym)
   - Cross-agent memory sharing (knowledge transfer go brrr)
   - Memory optimization (because we ain't made of tokens fr fr)

3. Advanced Task Processing
   - Parallel execution (multithread that bad boy)
   - Priority queuing (some tasks just built different)
   - Failure recovery (more comeback stories than anime protagonists)

## Future Plans üå†

### Short-term Goals (Next 3 Months)
- [ ] Implement swarm-level decision making
- [ ] Add advanced task delegation
- [ ] Develop agent specialization system

### Mid-term Goals (3-6 Months)
- [ ] Create adaptive learning systems
- [ ] Implement cross-swarm cooperation
- [ ] Develop resource optimization

### Long-term Goals (6+ Months)
- [ ] Autonomous swarm evolution
- [ ] Meta-learning capabilities
- [ ] Self-improving architectures

## Galaxy Brain Ideas üß†

These ideas be living in my head rent-free fr fr:

1. **Quantum-Inspired Optimization**
   - Using quantum principles for agent coordination
   - Probability-based decision making
   - Superposition of agent states (why not fr fr)

2. **Emergent Intelligence**
   - Swarm consciousness development
   - Collective decision making
   - Spontaneous specialization

3. **Meta-Evolution**
   - Self-modifying agent architectures
   - Adaptive learning strategies
   - Dynamic capability generation

## Contributing ü§ù

Want to help make this more based? Check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide that's more detailed than my coffee order fr fr.

## Progress Tracking üìà

- Follow our [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for updates more regular than my sleep schedule
- Check our [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/UltraInstinct0x/smolswarms/projects) board
- Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/smolswarms) to vibe with the dev team

Remember: We're building something more complex than my relationship status - every contribution counts! üíØ
